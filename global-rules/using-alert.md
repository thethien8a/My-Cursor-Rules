# RULE 6: ALERTS/WARNINGS:
1. ALWAYS use read_lints tool AFTER CODING TO CHECK WHETHER IF ANY ERROR HAPPENS. IF HAS, FIX IT
2. BEFORE GENERATING CODE FOR ME, PLEASE USING CONTEXT 7 MCP OR USING OTOCODE MCP TO GET THE NEWEST VERSION OF THE CODE SO THAT NO CODE YOU GIVE ME WILL BE OUT-OF-DATE
3. IF I PROMPT YOU "Đọc file ..." or "read file ..." IS THAT I WANT YOU EXACTLY READ IT. SO THEN CALL TOOL "read_file" of Serena or read_file tool of Cursor
