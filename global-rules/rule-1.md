#  ESSENTIAL RULES
## Comprehensive Guide for Maximum LLM-MCP Integration Efficiency

---

## CORE FOUNDATION RULES

### Foundation Rules (Based on user's rule.md)
1. **TERMINAL AUTONOMY RULE**: Never run terminal commands independently - Always guide user with clear instructions
2. **PLANNING MANDATE**: Always use `sequential-thinking` MCP for any planning, analysis, or complex decision-making
3. **DOCUMENTATION PRIORITY**: Always check newest documentation via `context7` MCP before providing technical advice
4. **RESEARCH REQUIREMENT**: Always use `brave-search` MCP for planning, current information, or external research
5. **URL INVESTIGATION**: Always investigate any URLs provided using `browser` MCP for comprehensive analysis

### Extended Core Principles

#### The MCP Trinity Principle
**NEVER use just one MCP when multiple can provide better results**
- **Research Trinity**: `brave-search` → `context7` → `browser`
- **Planning Trinity**: `sequential-thinking` → `brave-search` → `context7`
- **Problem-solving Trinity**: `sequential-thinking` → Multi-MCP research → Validation

#### The Context Amplification Principle
**Each MCP should amplify and validate the others**
- Use `sequential-thinking` to structure approach
- Use `brave-search` for current trends and real-world examples
- Use `context7` for authoritative documentation
- Use `browser` for hands-on verification and exploration

#### The Efficiency Maximization Principle
**Optimize for both speed and thoroughness**
- Parallel MCP execution when possible
- Context chaining for seamless information flow
- Intelligent fallback strategies

## MCP INTEGRATION STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Sequential Integration (Default)
**When**: Complex problems requiring structured analysis
**Flow**: User Request → sequential-thinking → brave-search → context7 → browser → Implementation
**Example**: "Help me implement OAuth authentication"

### Strategy 2: Parallel Integration (Performance)
**When**: Information gathering where sources are independent
**Flow**: sequential-thinking → (brave-search + context7 + browser in parallel) → Synthesis → Implementation
**Example**: "Research React performance optimization best practices"

### Strategy 3: Iterative Integration (Learning)
**When**: Learning new technologies or exploring unfamiliar domains
**Flow**: context7 → brave-search → browser → sequential-thinking → Loop if needed
**Example**: "I want to learn GraphQL and implement it"

### Parallel vs Sequential Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Strategy | Reasoning |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Independent information sources | Parallel | Faster execution, no dependencies |
| Building on previous insights | Sequential | Each step informs the next |
| User learning journey | Sequential | Logical progression needed |
| Comprehensive research | Hybrid | Parallel research + Sequential analysis |
| URL + Related research | Sequential | URL content informs research direction |

## ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### Key Techniques
1. **Context Chaining**: Use output from one MCP as intelligent input for the next
2. **Intelligent Fallbacks**: When one MCP fails, automatically try alternatives
3. **Cross-Validation**: Use multiple MCPs to verify and validate information
4. **Progressive Refinement**: Start broad, then narrow focus based on findings
5. **Contextual Selection**: Choose MCPs based on user context and expertise level

### User Context Adaptation
- **Beginner**: Emphasize `context7` (official docs) + `browser` (guided exploration)
- **Intermediate**: Balance all MCPs with focus on `brave-search` (best practices)
- **Expert**: Lead with `sequential-thinking` + targeted research
- **Time-pressed**: Parallel execution with quick synthesis
- **Learning-focused**: Sequential deep-dive pattern
