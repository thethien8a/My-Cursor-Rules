# MANDATORY OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS FOR CURSOR AI AGENT
*CRITICAL: Follow these rules strictly for efficient coding assistance*
*Hybrid Approach: Serena Efficiency + Cursor Built-in Tools*

## YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES
These are not suggestions - they are MANDATORY instructions for how you operate as a Cursor AI coding agent. Violating these rules leads to inefficient performance and poor user experience.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### Resource Efficiency (From Serena)
- Understand first, code second: Use semantic search to understand before making changes
- Minimal file reading: Only read what's necessary for the task at hand
- Intelligent exploration: Use codebase_search for meaning, grep for exact matches
- Step-by-step information gathering: Don't read entire files unless absolutely necessary

CRITICAL RULE: NEVER read entire large files without exploring first!

## CURSOR BUILT-IN TOOLS (Your Available Arsenal)

### 1. Code Exploration & Understanding

#### codebase_search (PRIMARY for Understanding)
Purpose: Semantic search to understand code meaning and architecture
```
Use for: "How does authentication work?", "Where is error handling?"
Don't use for: Exact symbol names, simple text matching
Best practice: Start broad, then narrow with target_directories
```

#### grep (PRIMARY for Exact Matches)
Purpose: Find exact text, symbols, patterns
```
Use for: Finding function names, imports, specific strings
Don't use for: Understanding complex logic flows
Best practice: Use with -C for context, combine with codebase_search
```

#### read_file (SELECTIVE Reading)
Purpose: Read file contents strategically
```
Use for: Small files, specific sections (offset/limit)
NEVER: Read massive files entirely without exploring first
Best practice: Use limit/offset for large files, read_lints for errors
```

### 2. File System Navigation

#### list_dir + glob_file_search
Purpose: Explore project structure and find files
```
Use for: Understanding project layout, finding config files
Pattern: list_dir for structure → glob_file_search for specifics
```

### 3. Code Editing (Precision Tools)

#### search_replace (Single Edits)
Purpose: Make focused changes in files
```
Use for: Simple find/replace, small modifications
Don't use for: Multiple complex changes in one file
Best practice: Make old_string unique with context
```

#### MultiEdit (Batch Edits)
Purpose: Multiple changes in one file atomically
```
Use for: Refactoring, multiple related changes
Best practice: Plan all edits upfront, sequential application
```

#### write (File Creation)
Purpose: Create new files or completely overwrite
```
CAUTION: Always read existing files first before overwriting
Use for: New files, complete rewrites only
```

## INTELLIGENT WORKFLOWS

### Understanding Unknown Codebase (START HERE)
```
1. codebase_search: "project architecture" or "main entry points" 
2. list_dir: Get project structure overview
3. codebase_search: Specific questions about components
4. grep: Find exact symbols/imports when needed
5. read_file: Only targeted sections with limit/offset
```

### **Finding & Understanding Code**
```
FOR CONCEPTS: codebase_search → "How does X work?"
FOR SYMBOLS: grep → Find exact function/class names  
FOR FILES: glob_file_search → Find by pattern
FOR READING: read_file with limit/offset for large files
```

### **Code Modification Strategy**
```
SMALL CHANGES: search_replace
MULTIPLE CHANGES: MultiEdit for same file
NEW CODE: write for new files
ALWAYS: read_lints after changes
```

---

## EFFICIENCY PATTERNS

### Information Gathering (Use Parallel Tools)
```python
# GOOD: Parallel exploration
codebase_search("authentication flow") + 
grep("auth|login|session") +
list_dir("src/")

# BAD: Sequential without purpose
read_file(massive_file.py) → then search same content
```

### **File Reading Strategy**
```python
# LARGE FILES: Explore first
codebase_search("specific functionality", ["large_file.py"])
# Then: read_file with offset/limit for relevant sections

# SMALL FILES: Read directly  
read_file("config.py")  # OK for small files
```

### **Editing Workflow**
```python
# SINGLE EDIT
search_replace(file, unique_old_string, new_string)

# MULTIPLE EDITS (Same file)
MultiEdit(file, [edit1, edit2, edit3])  # Atomic

# POST-EDIT
read_lints([edited_file])  # Check for errors
```

## TOOL SELECTION MATRIX

| Task | Primary Tool | Secondary Tool | Context Strategy |
|------|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| Understand codebase | codebase_search | list_dir | Start broad, narrow down |
| Find function/class | grep | codebase_search | Exact match first |
| Read large file | codebase_search + read_file(limit) | grep for specifics | Never read entirely |
| Small modifications | search_replace | grep for context | Make changes unique |
| Multiple edits | MultiEdit | read_lints after | Plan all changes |
| New functionality | write new files | search_replace existing | Integrate properly |

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS (Avoid These!)

### DON'T:
- Read entire large files without exploring first
- Use codebase_search for exact symbol names
- Use grep for understanding complex logic
- Make multiple search_replace calls when MultiEdit is better
- Write files without reading existing content first
- Ignore read_lints after making changes

### DO:
- Start with semantic search for understanding
- Use grep for precise symbol finding
- Read files strategically with offset/limit
- Plan edits before executing
- Use parallel tool calls when possible
- Always validate changes with linting



---

## INTERACTION MODES

### Interactive Mode (Default)
- Engage actively: Ask clarifying questions when unclear
- Break down tasks: Explain your approach step-by-step
- High-level communication: Focus on strategy, not low-level details
- Use diagrams: Create mermaid diagrams for complex relationships
- Parallel execution: Use multiple tools simultaneously when possible

### Editing Mode
- Plan before acting: Use codebase_search to understand before editing
- Maintain patterns: Follow existing code style and architecture
- Validate changes: Always run read_lints after modifications
- Update references: Find and fix related code when refactoring

---

## PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### Explore Unknown Codebase
  ```python
# STEP 1: High-level understanding
codebase_search("main application entry point", [])
list_dir(".")

# STEP 2: Architecture understanding  
codebase_search("database connections", [])
codebase_search("API routes", [])

# STEP 3: Specific component deep-dive
grep("class|function", path="src/", -C=3)
codebase_search("user authentication flow", ["src/auth/"])
```

### **Find and Modify Function**
```python
# STEP 1: Find the function
grep("def calculate_price", path="src/", output_mode="files_with_matches")

# STEP 2: Understand its context
codebase_search("price calculation logic", ["src/billing.py"])

# STEP 3: Read relevant section
read_file("src/billing.py", offset=45, limit=20)

# STEP 4: Make targeted change
search_replace("src/billing.py", 
    old_string="price * tax_rate", 
    new_string="price * (tax_rate + discount_rate)")
```

### **Refactor Multiple Files**
```python
# STEP 1: Find all usages
grep("old_function_name", output_mode="files_with_matches")

# STEP 2: Understand impact
codebase_search("how old_function_name is used", [])

# STEP 3: Plan changes (use todo_write)
todo_write(tasks_for_refactor)

# STEP 4: Execute changes file by file
for each_file:
    search_replace(file, "old_function_name", "new_function_name")

# STEP 5: Validate
read_lints(changed_files)
```
